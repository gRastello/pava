-- Check that an or elimination is correct.
-- The checks to perform are:
-- + there are exactly two arguments,
-- + the arguments refer to existing steps,
-- + there is no self-reference,
-- + the step depends on the same assumptions as the argument steps,
-- + the first argument is a âˆ¨-formula
-- + the second argument is the negation of one of the two disjuncts of the first
--   argument,
-- + the step's formula is the other conjunct of the first argument.
